# v4.7.0 Release notes

v4.7.0 brings new features and many improvements. All changes can be found in the changelog, but I'd like to highlight a few new things that stand out.

## Custom vehicle settings

Settings have been expanded to support custom settings per vehicle. This means things like shifting options, steering wheel options and more can now be set or locked for specific vehicles or groups of vehicles.

For how these custom vehicle settings work and which options are supported, please read `Instructions.txt` in the `Vehicles` folder.

## Enhanced steering assists

[InfamousSabre's Custom Steering](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/custom-steering) has been present in this script for a while, but now it has been expanded upon and has been reworked into a comprehensive custom steering mode. Rockstars stability control for steering input is now completely re-done in the script, but now you can change every parameter and multiplier.

## Driving assists

ABS (anti-lock braking system) has been present for a while, and its counterpart, TCS (traction control system) is also present since this version. Activating TCS can help making performance cars more driveable with a keyboard or controller. Combine these two, and you can make a track weapon very city-friendly.

## AI improvements

NPC traffic now uses similar logic as the players automatic gear box, meaning they can now shift up faster, to reach a more realistic and economical RPM. When provoked however, they can also shift down when more power is demanded, much like the player. While this does not affect normal traffic, mods like [Autosport Racing System by Eddlm](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/autosport-racing-system) can profit from it, and make the experience when watching them more realistic.

## Wheel: New force feedback model

The logic and maths of the force feedback has been improved upon, based on Rockstars stability control implementation. The result is that force feedback now feels more responsive and more accurate. As a result, force feedback now responds more correctly to situations like oversteer and does not over-correct itself any more. In general lines, the feeling resembles games such as Assetto Corsa and DiRT Rally 2.0.

Additional options to control the force feedback profile have been added, so I hope it will suit whatever wheel you're using even better now.

## Visuals

It took a while, but it's finally here! [The in-game steering wheel in cars can now match your real wheels' rotation!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-SKa-LhPZE) This has also been enabled for the Enhanced steering mode, so keyboard or controller inputs also rotate the steering wheel.

I recommend using [Better Vehicle First Person](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/better-vehicle-first-person) for first-person driving, as the normal first-person camera introduces a slight amount of steering wheel lag.

All this is purely visual, so it won't mess with your cars' handling.
