<b>Manual Transmission for GTA V</b>
This mod will enable manual transmission for vehicles, using the games' real gear box! This means real gears - not speed capping. There are plenty of features to emulate how real transmissions work.

Itâ€™s highly recommended to play with this mod using a controller or a wheel.

<b>Steering Wheel Support for GTA V</b>
With manual transmission enabled, you'll want to be able to properly control your vehicle. By default, GTA V doesn't support steering wheels. Solutions like X360CE only emulate a controller, and the game will miss definition and force feedback for wheels. For this, a large part of this mod is made to support wheels, natively! A few features:

<ul>
    <li>all DirectInput compatible steering wheels supported (since 4.0)</li>
    <li>force feedback is fully supported                               </li>
    <li>multiple input devices supported (since 4.2.0)        </li>
    <li>1:1 mapping of steering wheel to vehicle front wheels </li>
</ul>

<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Controller, keyboard and wheel input support</li>
	<li>Support for all land-based engine-powered vehicles</li>
	<li>Fully configurable</li>
	<li>Common transmission systems:
		<ul>
			<li>Sequential gearbox</li>
			<li>H-pattern gearbox</li>
			<li>Automatic gearbox</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Dynamic top gear detection</li>
	<li>Reverse with accelerator</li>
	<li>Engine and transmission mechanics:
		<ul>
			<li>Engine braking</li>
			<li>Engine damage</li>
			<li>Engine stalling</li>
			<li>Clutch grabbing</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>DirectInput Steering Wheel support:
		<ul>
			<li>All analog inputs can be assigned</li>
			<li>All buttons and Dpad can be assigned</li>
			<li>Multiple devices can be assigned</li>
			<li>Full Force Feedback supported</li>
			<li>Understeer and oversteer physics</li>
			<li>Works even when mod is off</li>
			<li>Assign wheel buttons to keyboard buttons</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Seamless input device switching</li>
</ul>

* ManualTransmission/settings_general.ini
* ManualTransmission/settings_wheel.ini
* What kind of inputs (wheel/controller/keyboard) you're using
* What you already tried to do
You can use <a href=www.pastebin.com>pastebin</a> to post the files.
