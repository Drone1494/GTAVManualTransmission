<b>Manual Transmission for GTA V</b>
This mod will enable manual transmission for vehicles, using the games' real gear box! This means real gears - not speed capping. There are plenty of features to emulate how real transmissions work.

It’s highly recommended to play with this mod using a controller or a wheel.

<b>Steering Wheel Support for GTA V</b>
With manual transmission enabled, you'll want to be able to properly control your vehicle. By default, GTA V doesn't support steering wheels. Solutions like X360CE only emulate a controller, and the game will miss definition and force feedback for wheels. For this, a large part of this mod is made to support wheels, natively! A few features:
<ul>
    <li>all DirectInput compatible steering wheels supported (since 4.0)</li>
    <li>force feedback is fully supported</li>
    <li>multiple input devices supported (since 4.2.0)</li>
    <li>1:1 mapping of steering wheel to vehicle front wheels</li>
</ul>
<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Real gears!</li>
	<li>Dynamic top gear detection</li>
	<li>Realistic input mapping with working clutch</li>
	<li>Engine and transmission effects</li>
	<li>Support for all land-based engine-powered vehicles</li>
	<li>Fully configurable</li>
	<li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vxhThdoLo>HUD with speed, RPM and shift mode</a></li>
	<li>Sequential, automatic and manual gearbox choices</li>
	<li>Controller, keyboard and wheel input support</li>
	<li>Seamless input device switching</li>
	<li>DirectInput Steering Wheel support</li>
</ul>
There's much more inside, so take a look!
