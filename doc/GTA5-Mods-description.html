<b>Manual Transmission for GTA V</b>
This mod will enable manual transmission for vehicles, using the games' real gear box! This means real gears - not speed capping. There are plenty of features to emulate how real transmissions work.

Itâ€™s highly recommended to play with this mod using a controller or a wheel.

<b>Steering Wheel Support for GTA V</b>
With manual transmission enabled, you'll want to be able to properly control your vehicle. By default, GTA V doesn't support steering wheels. Solutions like X360CE only emulate a controller, and the game will miss definition and force feedback for wheels. For this, a large part of this mod is made to support wheels, natively! A few features:
<ul>
    <li>all DirectInput compatible steering wheels supported (since 4.0)</li>
    <li>force feedback is fully supported</li>
    <li>multiple input devices supported (since 4.2.0)</li>
    <li>1:1 mapping of steering wheel to vehicle front wheels</li>
</ul>

<b>Features:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Real gears!</li>
	<li>Dynamic top gear detection</li>
	<li>Realistic input mapping with working clutch</li>
	<li>Engine and transmission effects</li>
	<li>Support for all land-based engine-powered vehicles</li>
	<li>Fully configurable</li>
	<li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vxhThdoLo>HUD with speed, RPM and shift mode</a></li>
	<li>Sequential, automatic and manual gearbox choices</li>
	<li>Controller, keyboard and wheel input support</li>
	<li>Seamless input device switching</li>
	<li>DirectInput Steering Wheel support</li>
	<li><a href=https://fivem.net/>FiveM support!</a> (client side)</li>
</ul>

There's much more inside, so take a look!

<b>Troubleshooting</b>
<i>Have you tried turning it off and on again?</i>
When asking for help, include the following:
* ManualTransmission/Gears.log
* ManualTransmission/settings_general.ini
* ManualTransmission/settings_wheel.ini
* What kind of inputs (wheel/controller/keyboard) you're using
* What you already tried to do

You can use <a href=www.pastebin.com>pastebin</a> to post the files.

<b>Known bugs and problems</b>
- Crashes with a <b>Logitech G920</b> and <b>ScriptHookVDotNet v2</b>. No workaround known.
- Wheel sticks to one side and/or brake/throttle stuck. Try switching the mod off and on again.
- Wheel oscillates a lot at high speed. Try decreasing physics force, or increasing damper force. A good handling mod also helps.
