# MT 4.8.0 Release notes

Hope you read that massive changelog! Here's a few things to pay attention to
when updating from 4.7.x. Also check the 4.7.0 release notes if you're updating
from 4.6.x or earlier.

## Animations

The script now overrides the animations and matches the steering wheel
rotation. The system needs a bit of help to understand what to do, though.

Let me know if anything is missing, so I can update `animations.yml` to support
as many vehicle types as possible out-of-the-box.

`animations.yml` is a text file containing the animation definitions: What
animations to use for which vehicle layouts, and how many degrees of rotation
chosen the animation supports. *Most* game vehicles are present already, but
most add-ons need to be added.

If a vehicle doesn't have matching animations, do this:

1. Open the `vehicles.meta` containing your car.
2. Go to `<layout>` for your car entry.
3. Copy the contents of that.
4. Paste it in `animations.yml` in a suitable animation. You can usually guess
what's suitable from the other entries already present.

If a vehicle defines an animation clipset *not* in `animations.yml`, it can
be added.

1. Check the layout name in `vehicles.meta`.
2. Check the corresponding clipset dictionaries in `vehiclelayouts.meta`
3. Check the corresponding clipset dictionaries in `clip_sets.xml`
4. Make an educated guess what the dictionary is for your vehicle
5. Check the dictionary in `clip_anim.rpf`
6. Open the `.ycd` in notepad and hope you find a `steer_no_lean` or `pov_steer`
7. Copy an `- Animation:` entry in `animations.yml` - mind the indentation!
8. Substutite the dictionary and animation name for your vehicle, replace
layouts with your new layout and throw in an educated guess what the rotation
degree is.

[AlexGuirre's animation list](https://alexguirre.github.io/animations-list/).

If the current steering angle is more than what the animation supports, it will
just stay at the maximum.

## Camera

When animations are active, it clamps the camera rotation in FPV to about
15 degrees. I added a first person vehicle camera which allows for more freedom.

Grab [Dismemberment](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/dismemberment)
by jedijosh. The script uses `DismembermentASI.asi` by CamxxCore to hide the
player head in first person mode, so you're not looking at your characters'
eyes and teeth.

Another feature is movement following - the camera can look at where you're
going to be, rotation included. Since this mostly works better with a wheel,
it can be turned off.

For the rest - both mouse and controller look are supported, and there are a
bunch of things to customize.

Alternatively, check out these camera scripts!

* [Custom Camera V Plus](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/custom-camera-v-plus)
* [Better Vehicle First Person](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/better-vehicle-first-person)
* [Drive Modes](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/drive-modes)

They're not compatible, but you can turn off my camera and they should work
without conflicts.

## Dashboard

The script can now toggle dashboard lights. Currently it flashes the ABS light
if ABS action is detected, and turns on a bunch of warning lights when stalled.

Grab [DashHook](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/dashhook) for the extra eye
candy.

## Community contributions

A huge thanks to [Nyconing](https://github.com/Nyconing) and
[guilhermelimak](https://github.com/guilhermelimak)!

Nyconing added a custom, alternative automatic transmission. It can be
activated in the automatic transmission options.

guilhermelimak fixed a few issues with the UDP telemetry gear data. It should
now be fully compatible with the DiRT 4 when used with SimHub.
