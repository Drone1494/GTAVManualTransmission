<b>Manual Transmission for GTA V</b>
This mod will enable manual transmission for vehicles, using the games' real gear box! This means real gears - not speed capping. There are plenty of features to emulate how real transmissions work.

<b>Steering Wheel Support for GTA V</b>
Additionally, this mod has <b>full</b> support for steering wheels since version 4.0! All steering wheels properly compatible with DirectInput should work. Force feedback is fully supported. Steering wheel support is always turned on, so it also works without manual transmission!

<b>Installation</b>
Extract Gears.asi and Gears.ini to your GTA V main folder. Configure the ini however you like, please read Configuration.pdf for this. The .ini itself also contains useful information.
<b>Important note for non-QWERTY users! Change Throttle under "Keyboard" in Gears.ini to match your keyboard locale for throttle and brake. This is needed for correct reverse/brake processing.</b>
